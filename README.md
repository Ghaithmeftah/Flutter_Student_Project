# eniso_project

A brand-new Flutter project. It gave me and my classmates access to course PDF materials for every semester of our engineering education.
The application's sign in and sign up interfaces are linked with Firebase, and each semester is charged dynamically from the Firebase console, as are the pfds, which are uploaded from the Firebase console into the app's pdf viewer.
This app allows students to find pdf courses and exams.
